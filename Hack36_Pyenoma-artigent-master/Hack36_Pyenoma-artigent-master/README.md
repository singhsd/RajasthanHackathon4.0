Deep Learning to Classify Trash using Convolution Neural Networks(CNN)

Motivation
Deep Learning can be implemented to eliminate the manual trash classification which is used to identify recyclable waste in trash.

Vision
We will be solving an image classification problem, where our goal will be to tell which class the input image belongs to. The way we are going to achieve it is by training an artificial neural network on few thousand images of various kind of trash and make the NN(Neural Network) learn to predict which class the image belongs to, next time it sees an image having a particular category of trash in it.

Abstract
The process of building a Convolutional Neural Network always involves four major steps.
Step - 1 : Convolution
Step - 2 : Pooling
Step - 3 : Flattening
Step - 4 : Full connection

With keras using Tensorflow backend, the trash classifier is trained and tested.
